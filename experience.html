                <p class="overview"> In the course Design of Human Machine Interface at THI we had a collaboration with the students of the course Interaction Design at York University in Toronto. The key question was how elderly people aged 65+ can be helped to improve their well-being and health. This comprises cognitive, physical and social well-being and typical issues faced by old people in general.</p>

        <h3 class="text">PROCESS</h3>
        <p class="text">These are the steps til our idea "seness" was finally born:
            <ul>
                <li class="text step">Step 1: Idea<p class="description">Thinking about the approach to the overall project, we finally
                    decided to make the improvement of physical and cognitive health to our main goal. So we came up with our application named „seness“, which is a combination of the words „senior“ and „fitness“. It is particularly used in retirement homes and is aimed to give the elderly people a more valuable and independent life with the help of playful and motivational exercises, which are individually tailored to their needs.  </p>
                </li>
                <li class="text step">Step 2: Personas<p class="description">With regards to our idea, we decided to create twoelderly people and one caregiver as personas. The great challenge with the created personas was to combine all the different personalities goals and frustrations so that the application will fit to their individual character. Wanna have a look at our personas? Just <a class="link persona" href="user.html#personas-wrapper">click here</a>.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="text step">Step 3: Prototyping<p class="description">In order to develop our idea, try out different layouts and create a rough concept for the app, we started with the paper prototype. After that we started wireframing.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="text step">Step 4: Moodboard<p class="description">Moodboards are a great way to experiment with different colors, fonts, and overall style. As part of our project, we had to make four moodboards.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="text step">Step 5: Screen Design<p class="description">We used our wireframes that we created with Adobe XD as the basis for our screendesign. We used the color scheme we created earlier to design our screens and tried to represent the right mood from our moodboard. The user interface examples from the moodboard were also a good source of inspiration. We decided to create the screendesign using Illustrator.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="text step">Step 6: Storyboard<p class="description">Applied to UX, storyboarding allows us to walk through the user journey. It can convey how your participants interacted with an application or site and following visually predicts and explores a user’s experience with a product. Moreover, it helps designers to string together personas, user stories and various research findings to develop requirements for the product.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="text step">Step 7: Movie<p class="description">Our last step in this project was to create a two minute image video - which you can see above - mainly to show and explain the content like idea, concept and design of our project. The basis for our video was the previously created storyboard, with which we had already planned scene by scene and the chronological sequence.</p>
